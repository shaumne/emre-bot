Liquidity Rewards
Polymarket provides incentives aimed at catalyzing the supply and demand side of the marketplace. Specifically there is a public liquidity rewards program as well as one-off public pnl/volume competitions.

​
Overview
By posting resting limit orders, liquidity providers (makers) are automatically eligible for Polymarket’s incentive program. The overall goal of this program is to catalyze a healthy, liquid marketplace. We can further define this as creating incentives that:
Catalyze liquidity across all markets
Encourage liquidity throughout a market’s entire lifecycle
Motivate passive, balanced quoting tight to a market’s mid-point
Encourages trading activity
Discourages blatantly exploitative behaviors
This program is heavily inspired by dYdX’s liquidity provider rewards which you can read more about here. In fact, the incentive methodology is essentially a copy of dYdX’s successful methodology but with some adjustments including specific adaptations for binary contract markets with distinct books, no staking mechanic a slightly modified order utility-relative depth function and reward amounts isolated per market. Rewards are distributed directly to the maker’s addresses daily at midnight UTC.
​
Methodology
Polymarket liquidity providers will be rewarded based on a formula that rewards participation in markets (complementary consideration!), boosts two-sided depth (single-sided orders still score), and spread (vs. mid-market, adjusted for the size cutoff!). Each market still configure a max spread and min size cutoff within which orders are considered the average of rewards earned is determined by the relative share of each participant’s Qn in market m.
Variable	Description
$	order position scoring function
v	max spread from midpoint (in cents)
s	spread from size-cutoff-adjusted midpoint
b	in-game multiplier
m	market
m’	market complement (i.e NO if m = YES)
n	trader index
u	sample index
c	scaling factor (currently 3.0 on all markets)
Qne	point total for book one for a sample
Qno	point total for book two for a sample
Spread%	distance from midpoint (bps or relative) for order n in market m
BidSize	share-denominated quantity of bid
AskSize	share-denominated quantity of ask

Steps
Quadratic scoring rule for an order based on position between the adjusted midpoint and the minimum qualifying spread
Calculate first market side score. Assume a trader has the following open orders:
100Q bid on m @0.49 (adjusted midpoint is 0.50 then spread of this order is 0.01 or 1c)
200Q bid on m @0.48
100Q ask on m’ @0.51
and assume an adjusted market midpoint of 0.50 and maxSpread config of 3c for both m and m’. Then the trader’s score is:
