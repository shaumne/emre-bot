Builder Program Introduction
Learn about Polymarket’s Builder Program and how to integrate your platform

​
What is a Builder?
In the context of Polymarket, a “builder” refers to a person, group, or organization that routes orders from their customers to Polymarket. For example, if you’ve created a unique front end that allows your users to place trades on Polymarket via your system, then this guide is for you.

Builder Program Benefits
The Builders Program currently provides two main benefits:
​
1. Polygon Relayer Access
We expose our Polygon relayer to builders, allowing you to route on-chain transactions through our infrastructure. This means:
Polymarket pays for gas fees on your behalf (when using our Safe Wallets)
You can deploy Safe Wallets for your users and customers
​
2. Trading Attribution
When posting orders to our CLOB exchange, you can add custom headers that identify you as a builder. This enables Polymarket to clearly attribute orders coming from your platform.
High volume builders will be showcased in our upcoming Builder Leaderboard allowing Builders to compete for grants from Polymarket.
